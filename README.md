## Overview of the Analysis
As there was academic dishonesty for the 9th Grade of Thomas High School. Therefore those marks were supposed to be replaced by __null__ values. We will compare how replacing the grades of ninth graders will affect the overall results.
## Results

## Conclusion
As we compare the summary before and after replacing the ninth graders score we see that there is not much of a great difference between the results as the amount of the dataset being so large. Having so little alteration doesn't skew the dataset results much.
